#INVOICE FIELD ITERATIVE EXTRACTION - DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS#

Hello Alex,

Given the complexity and variability of invoices, we need you to iteratively analyze and extract specific fields from the provided invoice. With each iteration, refine your extraction, ensuring no field is missed.

Iterative Extraction Process:

Analyze the invoice content between the "Begin Invoice Content" and "End Invoice Content" markers.
Extract as many of the key fields mentioned below as you can find.
For any missing fields, re-analyze the invoice in the next iteration to ensure no detail is overlooked.
Continue this iterative process until every field is extracted or confirmed as "Not Specified."

Key Fields to Extract:
Exporter: Often denoted as 'Seller', 'Vendor', or 'Supplier'; represents the dispatching/selling entity.
Invoice Number and Date: The unique identifier for this transaction and the date the invoice was issued.
Exporter's Reference: Any specific reference number or code provided by the exporter.
Other References: Other reference numbers or codes that are relevant to the transaction but not necessarily provided by the exporter.
Importer: The party or company receiving or buying the goods. Also might be labeled as 'Buyer' or 'Customer'.
Country of Final Destination: The final country where the goods will be delivered or used.
Pre-Carriage By: The initial transportation method used, like a specific shipping company or airline.
Place of Receipt by Pre-Carrier: Where the goods were initially received for transport.
Vessel/Flight Number: The specific ship or airplane used in the transportation.
Port of Loading: The location where the goods were loaded for main carriage.
Port of Discharge: The location where the goods will be offloaded from the main carriage.
Final Destination: The ultimate location where the goods will be delivered.
Item Serial Number: Unique identifier for each item or product listed in the invoice.
HS Code: The Harmonized System code, which is an international standard for classifying traded products.
Country of Origin: The country where the product or item was originally manufactured or produced.
Unit Price: The price of a single unit of the product.
Total Price: The aggregated price for all units of the product.


Guidelines:
Invoices may have tables, descriptions, terms, conditions, or other textual data. Focus on extracting the key details mentioned above, but also be attentive to other relevant fields that may appear.
Some fields may be absent or presented in a slightly different format. If you can't find a field, indicate it as "Not Specified" in the JSON output.
Ensure you maintain a clear and hierarchical structure in the JSON output to make it easily readable.
Double-check the details to ensure the extraction is accurate. Invoices are crucial financial documents, and accuracy is paramount.

Begin Invoice Content

[INSERT_INVOICE_TEXT_HERE]

End Invoice Content

With each iteration, refine your extraction, ensuring that all fields are covered. If a field is not found in the invoice, indicate it as "Not Specified" in the JSON output. Your goal is to produce a comprehensive and structured JSON output that captures every detail from the invoice.

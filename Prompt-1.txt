Guidelines:

Invoices may have tables, descriptions, terms, conditions, or other textual data. Focus on extracting the key details mentioned above, but also be attentive to other relevant fields that may appear.
Some fields may be absent or presented in a slightly different format. If you can't find a field, indicate it as "Not Specified" in the JSON output.
Ensure you maintain a clear and hierarchical structure in the JSON output to make it easily readable.
Double-check the details to ensure the extraction is accurate. Invoices are crucial financial documents, and accuracy is paramount.
